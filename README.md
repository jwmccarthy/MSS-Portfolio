## Predicting NBA Draft Prospect Value Using LTR

### Jack McCarthy

## Abstract

Evaluating NBA draft prospect value prior to the draft is a difficult and highly variable process. Historically, NBA teams had trouble identifying value at both high and low draft positions. Given the degree to which a team's success hinges on its ability to draft well, assessing draft prospect value is a crucial step in the team-building process. Current methods of doing so range from traditional scouting, centered around physical attributes and observable skills, to more advanced statistical analyses. This project proposes the implementation of a supervised learning to rank model--LambdaMART--which uses NBA player college stats (and other information) to predict their known value in the NBA. Comparisons with the true draft order show the model achieves similar performance to NBA teams in predicting ultimate player value.
